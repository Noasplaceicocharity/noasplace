# A Message From Our Founder

**No family should have to reach crisis before they get support.**

Thatâ€™s the belief that started **Noaâ€™s Place**.

Hi, Iâ€™m **Josh Barnes** â€” and Iâ€™m Dad to Noa, the little boy who changed everything for us.

Noa has complex sensory and developmental needs. Heâ€™s full of joy, determination, and wonderâ€¦ but our journey as a family hasnâ€™t been easy.

When we first realised Noa needed extra support, we were hit with long NHS waiting lists, a maze of forms and assessments, and silence when we were desperate for guidance. We felt isolated. We were scared. And we were completely on our own.

We saw firsthand how families are expected to keep going, often until they completely break â€” and only *then* does support arrive. By that point, the damage is already done.

Thatâ€™s why we created **Noaâ€™s Place**.

## What Weâ€™re Building

Noaâ€™s Place will be a warm, inclusive hub where children, adults, and families with additional needs can:

- **Explore sensory rooms and quiet spaces**
- **Play together in an accessible indoor play area**
- **Breathe and connect in a calm community cafÃ©**
- **Join workshops, support groups, and access resources _before_ things reach crisis**

Itâ€™s the place we wished existed for Noa â€” and now weâ€™re building it for every family who needs it.

## The Response So Far

When we shared our vision, something amazing happened:

- Over **1,000 people** signed their support in just **12 days**
- Our story has been featured on **BBC Look North** and in the **Yorkshire Post**
- Weâ€™re meeting with local leaders, forming our trustee board, and preparing to register as an official charity

The message is clear: families want this â€” and they need it.
