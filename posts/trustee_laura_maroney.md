#  Welcoming Our First Trustee – Laura Maroney

We’re delighted to introduce **Laura Maroney** as the **very first trustee of Noa’s Place**. 

Laura has worked in the world of **neurodiversity and inclusion** for many years, always keeping children, young people, and families at the heart of her work. She is passionate about ensuring every child and family feels included, supported, and empowered – no matter their background or circumstances.

As a trustee for Noa’s Place, Laura brings her experience and dedication to inclusion to help shape our vision and ensure our work truly reflects the needs of the families we support.  

> *“I believe that inclusion isn’t just a word – it’s a way of working, living, and connecting.”* – Laura

We’re so excited to have Laura join our founding board, helping us build a space where **children and families of every ability can play, learn, and belong – together.**

**Stay tuned** as we continue to introduce more of our incredible trustees over the coming weeks!
