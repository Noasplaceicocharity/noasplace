Strapline
Together we make space for every family to shine.

Together
This means no one has to manage things alone.
Life can feel heavy when support is hard to find. At Noa’s Place, we lift that weight together. Children, young people, adults, parents, carers, volunteers and staff support one another. Everyone has something to offer and something they need. We walk alongside each other so that nobody feels isolated

We
This means everyone is part of this community.
When we say “we,” we mean the whole Noa’s Place family, people with lived experience, neurodivergent adults, disabled adults, parents, carers, siblings, friends, and professionals who care. There is no “us and them” here. We learn from each other, respect each other and make decisions together. We are equals.

Make
This means we take action and build what is needed.

We do not wait for crisis or diagnosis to offer support. We listen to families and respond together, creating support that is realistic and within our capacity.

Space
This means a safe, calm and accepting place to simply be yourself.
Space may be a room, a quiet corner, a group, a conversation, or time to breathe. It is a place where no one has to mask, rush, explain or apologise for who they are. Whether someone communicates with words, movement, technology or silence, there is space for them here. Everyone is welcome to take things at their own pace.

Every Family
This means every person and every life situation is included.
Family can be biological, chosen, foster, blended, professional support networks or self-defined. You do not need a diagnosis, label or referral to belong. Whether someone is just beginning to explore neurodiversity, waiting for support, or has known their differences for years, they are welcome. We accept people as they are.

Shine
This means we recognise and celebrate the unique strengths in every person.
We don’t try to change people to fit the world we create places where the world fits them. We notice joy, creativity, intelligence, humour, resilience, sensitivity, curiosity and individuality. Everyone has something bright in them. At Noa’s Place, that light is seen and supported.
Vision statement
We create welcoming spaces where neurodivergent and disabled individuals and families find understanding, connection, and community. You’re welcome exactly as you are. This is a place where everyone can simply be themselves and shine.

Mission statement
Our mission is to create calm, inclusive, and sensory aware spaces thoughtfully designed for neurodivergent and disabled individuals and families. We listen, we understand, and we respond with kindness, building a supportive community where no one is ever left to face challenges alone.

Belonging - No one should feel alone here. Everyone has a place.
