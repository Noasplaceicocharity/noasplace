Some steps in a journey feel small on the surface, but mean everything underneath.

This month, **Noa’s Place held our first official trustee meeting**.  
We sat together all bringing different experiences but shared values. We reviewed and **formally approved the constitution**, the document that shapes how Noa’s Place will grow, make decisions, and protect the families and individuals we exist for.

It was one of those moments that makes you pause.  
A moment that says, *This is real. We’re building something that matters.*


## Welcoming Our New Co-Chairs

We are honoured to welcome our newly appointed Co-Chairs:

### **Megan Taylor**
A thoughtful voice who brings both lived experience and strength. Megan understands the emotional landscape families face when trying to access support. She leads with empathy, steadiness, and deep compassion.

### **Laura Maroney**
A dedicated advocate with a heart for community, inclusion, and creating belonging. Laura brings clarity, calm, and a commitment to ensuring every decision we make reflects the values Noa’s Place was founded on.

Together, they bring balance and courage guiding Noa’s Place with humility and shared purpose.


## Why This Milestone Matters

Noa’s Place is, and always has been, about **belonging**.  
Belonging before diagnosis. Belonging before paperwork.  
Belonging before a family reaches their breaking point.

By approving our constitution and forming our governance structure, we are moving closer to:

- Becoming a registered Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO)  
- Accessing sustainable funding and grant support  
- Opening our first sensory-first community hub in West Yorkshire  
- Providing early, accessible support to families who need to feel seen and understood  

Every step is intentional. Every step is for the community we serve.


## What’s Next

Over the coming months, we will be:

- Continuing community conversations  
- Beginning early fundraising work  
- Shaping the first version of our sensory-first hub
