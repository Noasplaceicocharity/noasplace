**Noa’s Place** welcomes the government’s new commitment to building a **prevention-first early support system** rooted in fairness, connection, and long-term outcomes for children and families.  

For many years, families navigating neurodiversity and SEND have told us that support often comes too late, is difficult to access, or requires them to reach crisis point before help becomes available. This announcement recognises the need for earlier, more coordinated support — something we strongly support.

---

## Why This Matters

Although Noa’s Place is still in the process of developing our physical community space, our long-term vision is fully aligned with this national direction.  

Our constitution commits us to improving understanding of neurodiversity, supporting families before needs escalate, and reducing social isolation through inclusive education, peer support, and community-based approaches.  

We believe every family should be able to access reassurance, practical guidance, and connection *before* difficulties become overwhelming.

## A Step Toward Early, Compassionate Support

The government’s plan to help parents understand child development earlier, to offer joined-up advice across health, early years, and SEND, and to ensure families can receive answers and support in one place, is exactly the kind of transformation our future Hub is being built to complement.  

We particularly welcome the focus on **community-based SEND practitioners**, as bringing support closer to families removes barriers and provides a more humane, proactive system.

---

## Our Role Moving Forward

As progress continues nationally, Noa’s Place is committed to playing a constructive role locally.  
While we are not yet delivering physical services, we are working towards establishing an inclusive centre where families can access **sensory-considerate spaces, practical workshops, peer support, and early support rooted in lived experience**.  

Today’s announcement strengthens our mission and reinforces the importance of the work ahead.

---

## Looking Ahead

We look forward to collaborating with **local partners, councils, early years settings, and SEND teams** as this new early support vision develops.  

Together, we can build a future where every neurodivergent child, young person, and family is seen, supported, and able to be fully themselves — long before crisis ever appears.
