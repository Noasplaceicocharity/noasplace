The announcement of the **Every Child Achieving and Thriving White Paper** marks one of the most significant proposed changes to the SEND system in England in over a decade. The government has outlined a £4 billion reform package aimed at improving support for children and increasing inclusion within mainstream schools.

Noa’s Place is a politically neutral charity focused solely on improving outcomes for children and families. Our response is grounded in lived experience, evidence, and the voices of the families we support.

We welcome the acknowledgement that the current system is not working well enough for children, families, schools, or local authorities. Many parents have been saying this for years, and it is encouraging to see this recognised at a national level.

The proposed reforms include earlier support within schools, improved access to specialist professionals such as therapists through new services, and additional investment in mainstream provision. These ambitions reflect priorities families have consistently told us matter.

However, we also recognise why many families feel anxious. Under current proposals, Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) would mainly be reserved for children with the most complex needs, with more children supported through new plans delivered by schools. For families, the central issue is not what a support plan is called, but whether support is delivered reliably and consistently in practice.

At Noa’s Place, we believe reform must be guided by one simple principle: 
 
**Support must come before crisis, not after families have fought for it.**

We will be reviewing the full proposals carefully and listening closely to parents, carers, professionals and young people. We are committed to sharing clear explanations so families understand what is changing, what is not changing, and how they can have their voice heard during the consultation period.

Reform can be a positive step forward, but only if it strengthens support, protects rights, and makes life easier for families rather than harder. We look forward to contributing constructively to the national conversation and ensuring lived experience remains at the centre of decisions.
