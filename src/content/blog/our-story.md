Hi, I'm **Josh**, and together with my wife **Taya**, we're building something that we wish had existed when we needed it most.

<br>When our little boy **Noa** was born, we quickly realised that his world looked and felt a little different. He had complex sensory needs that made everyday things like eating, sleeping, or going out incredibly hard. What we didn’t expect was how lonely it would all feel.

We asked for help. We waited. We tried again. But we were told *“he doesn’t meet the criteria yet,”* or *“come back when things get worse.”* It was heartbreaking to watch Noa struggle, to see him hurting himself because he couldn’t tell us what he needed, and to know there was nowhere we could turn for real support.

Those months were some of the hardest of our lives. We felt isolated, unheard, and completely on our own. But through that pain, something started to grow. An idea that no family should ever feel this way again.

That’s how **Noa’s Place** was born.

**Noa’s Place** is our vision for a safe, inclusive hub where children, adults, and families with additional needs can come together. A place full of warmth, understanding, and belonging. Somewhere you don’t have to explain yourself or wait for help. A calm in the storm for parents and carers.

Every message, every story, every person who’s joined us so far reminds me why we’re doing this. We’re not just creating a building,we’re creating a lifeline.

We’re still at the beginning of this journey, but with over a thousand people already supporting our plans, I know we’re building something truly special.

Thank you for believing in this vision and standing with us. Together, we're building hope for families everywhere.
