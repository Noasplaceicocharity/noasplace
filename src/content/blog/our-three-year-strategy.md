At Noa’s Place, we often talk about **making space**.  
Space to breathe. Space to be understood. Space to exist without explanation.

Our three year strategy is about turning that belief into something real, practical, and sustainable. It sets out how we will grow carefully and intentionally, always led by lived experience and guided by the families we serve.

This strategy is not about rushing.  
It’s about building something that lasts.

## Our Vision

We are creating welcoming spaces where neurodivergent and disabled individuals and families find understanding, connection, and community.

You are welcome exactly as you are.  
This is a place where everyone can simply be themselves and shine.

---

## Our Mission

Our mission is to create calm, inclusive, and sensory aware spaces thoughtfully designed for neurodivergent and disabled individuals and families.

We listen.  
We understand.  
We respond with kindness.

No one should ever have to face challenges alone.

---

## Our Values

Everything we do at Noa’s Place is shaped by a small number of deeply held values:

- **Kindness**  
  We meet every family with patience, warmth, and compassion.

- **Belonging**  
  No one should feel alone. Everyone has a place here.

- **Listening**  
  Families and individuals help shape what we do and how we do it.

- **Calm**  
  We create sensory-considerate spaces where people can breathe.

- **Growth**  
  We support small steps, personal strengths, and long-term flourishing.

## Our Strategic Priorities for the Next Three Years

Over the next three years, our work will focus on four clear priorities.

### 1. Create an Inclusive Hub

Our first priority is to establish Noa’s Place as a physical, welcoming hub.

This means:
- Developing and reviewing a clear strategic plan  
- Securing funding to open and operate a dedicated space  
- Creating a calm, inclusive building where families feel safe and supported  

Our goal is for families to have somewhere they can come without referral, without pressure, and without fear of being misunderstood.

---

### 2. Provide Opportunities That Bring Families Together

Connection matters.

We will develop simple, practical resources that support families in everyday life, alongside groups, sessions, and activities that bring people together once the hub is open.

These opportunities will be:
- Co-designed with families  
- Sensory-aware and inclusive  
- Focused on confidence, connection, and belonging  

Families should not have to navigate this journey in isolation.

---

### 3. Build Strong Relationships With Families and Partners

Community is at the heart of Noa’s Place.

We will:
- Involve families directly in shaping what we do  
- Create spaces for listening, co-design, and shared decision-making  
- Build trusted partnerships with schools, services, councils, community organisations, and local leaders  

We want Noa’s Place to be known as a supportive, collaborative presence — not a gatekeeper.

---

### 4. Ensure the Hub Is Sustainable for the Future

For Noa’s Place to truly serve families long-term, it must be well governed, transparent, and sustainable.

Over the next three years, we will:
- Complete the steps to become a registered charity  
- Build a skilled, diverse board  
- Maintain strong financial systems and policies  
- Establish a supportive volunteer and staff community, including meaningful opportunities for SEND individuals  

Sustainability is not just about funding.  
It’s about trust, care, and doing things properly.

---

## A Steady Way Forward

This three year strategy gives us a clear direction, but it is not rigid.  
We will review it regularly, listen carefully, and adapt as families tell us what they need.

Noa’s Place exists because families deserve support **before crisis**, not after.

Together, we are making space — not just for now, but for the future.
